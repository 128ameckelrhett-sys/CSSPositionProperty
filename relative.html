    <h1>The most notable thing about this paragraph is that its position is its relative and can be changed in loctation.</h1>
    <p>The most notable thing about this paragraph is that its position is relative and can be changed in loctation.<br>
        Their is truely nothing that could concivably be considered more interesting about it. That makes me wonder how<br>
        long I can make this text box.<br>
        <br>
        One time when I was 6, me and my family went to a raptor show in France, it was very cool, they had a secratary
        bird and everything. <br>
        <br>
        Since I need more space taken up I am going to copy and paste the entire declaration of independance into this page. The<br>
        unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it
        becomes<br>
        necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to
        assume<br>
        among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's
        God<br>
        entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which<br>
        impel them to the separation.<br>
        <br>
        We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their
        Creator<br>
        with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to<br>
        secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of
        the<br>
        governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the<br>
        People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles
        and<br>
        organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.<br>
        Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and
        transient<br>
        causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are<br>
        sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long
        train<br>
        of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under
        absolute<br>
        Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for<br>
        their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the
        necessity<br>
        which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great<br>
        Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of
        an<br>
        absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.<br>
        <br>
        He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.<br>
        <br>
        He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their<br>
        operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to
        them.<br>
        <br>
        He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people
        would<br>
        relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to
        tyrants<br>
        only.<br>
        <br>
        He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository
        of<br>
        their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.<br>
        <br>
        He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the
        rights<br>
        of the people.<br>
        <br>
        He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the
        Legislative<br>
        powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State
        remaining<br>
        in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.<br>
        <br>
        He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for<br>
        Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the<br>
        conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.<br>
        <br>
        He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary<br>
        powers.<br>
        <br>
        He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment
        of<br>
        their salaries.<br>
        <br>
        He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat
        out<br>
        their substance.<br>
        <br>
        He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.<br>
        <br>
        He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.<br>
        <br>
        He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged
        by<br>
        our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:<br>
        <br>
        For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:<br>
        <br>
        For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the<br>
        Inhabitants of these States:<br>
        <br>
        For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:<br>
        <br>
        For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:<br>
        <br>
        For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:<br>
        <br>
        For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:<br>
        <br>
        For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary<br>
        government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for<br>
        introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:<br>
        <br>
        For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our<br>
        Governments:<br>
        <br>
        For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all<br>
        cases whatsoever.<br>
        <br>
        He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.<br>
        <br>
        He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.<br>
        <br>
        He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death,
        desolation<br>
        and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous<br>
        ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.<br>
        <br>
        He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to<br>
        become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.<br>
        <br>
        He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our<br>
        frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of
        all<br>
        ages, sexes and conditions.<br>
        <br>
        In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated<br>
        Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act<br>
        which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.<br>
        <br>
        Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of<br>
        attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the<br>
        circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and
        magnanimity,<br>
        and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would<br>
        inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and
        of<br>
        consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them,
        as<br>
        we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.<br>
        <br>
        We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing
        to<br>
        the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the<br>
        good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right
        ought<br>
        to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that
        all<br>
        political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and
        that<br>
        as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances,
        establish<br>
        Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do.<br>
        And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we<br>
        mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.
